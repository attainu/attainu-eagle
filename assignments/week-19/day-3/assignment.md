Find inorder, preorder traversal of tree using recursive and iterative approach.

Step 1: Create a BST.
Step 2: Insert some elements. let say five values.
Step 3: Perform inorder recursively
Step 4: Perform inorder iteratively
Step 5: Perform preorder recursively
Step 6: Perform preorder iteratively
