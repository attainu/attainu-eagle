Create a react project without Create-React-App which should have the following

1. An index.html file
2. An index.js file - where you will pick the root element and render the App
3. An app.js file - rendering some JSX
4. A header.js file - rendering some JSX
5. A footer.js file - rendering some JSX
6. Multiple css files(one for each component)

The header and footer component must be imported and shown inside the App component

Use Webpack to setup the project, setup appropriate loaders for JS and CSS
Research about what loader to use and setup to convert JSX and make the app functional
