Create a medical application where someone can come and book

1. HOME CARE services - NURSE, PHYSIOTHERAPIST, COOK
2. CONCIERGE services - AMBULANCE, HEARSE etc
3. MEDICAL EQUIPMENT services - OXYGEN CYLINDER, PACE MAKER, WHEELCHAIR

There are to be shown in tabs, 3 tabs on the page, at the top, on click of which the services will be shown

P.S - It would be great if you could pick corresponding images or icons for the services from google and add them

Each of one these services, ex. Nurse, Ambulance, Oxygen Cylinder, will have their own starting and closing time in a day, and charge rates per hour, and you can book them for a certain number of hours, on a certain day, and at the bottom, you will get the total price of all the services you've booked.
